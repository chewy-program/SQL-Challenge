# SQL-Challenge
 
 1. sql-schema is the query importing the csv's and creating the table.  
	The relation has been updated to the current repository but it may take some configuration to read in correctly. (it worked on my PC and in the github locally) 
 2. sql-query is the query on the table that will show each result requested
 3. ER diagram contains the ER relationships used to collect information.
